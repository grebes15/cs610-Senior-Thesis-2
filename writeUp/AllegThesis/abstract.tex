As a programmer, it is inevitable to encounter logic based bugs and it is imperative to be able to fix the issues. One approach to this situation is to use tools that helps detect logic bugs. Tools can assist programmers to find logic errors so they can spend time on different tasks in their projects. This paper presents an empirical study to examine three tools FindBugs, PMD, and Checkstyle used to find logic based bugs in Java programs.
